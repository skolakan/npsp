This is the location for the code of the Nonprofit Starter Pack which is made available by the Salesforce.com Foundation to nonprofits.
The NPSP is a set of customizations to Salesforce.com CRM that supports some common nonprofit business processes. The Nonprofit Starter Pack consists of custom fields, custom objects, reports, workflow, page layouts, Force.com Code (Apex) and VisualForce pages.

[Detailed documentation of the Nonprofit Starter Pack](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Nonprofit_Starter_Pack) resides on another wiki. This site will focus on code and community aspects of the Nonprofit Starter Pack.
## Vision of the Nonprofit Starter Pack ##
The Nonprofit Starter Pack will:
  * provide a frictionless way for a small/med nonprofit organization to get up on Salesforce.com in an intuitive way
  * be a way to catalyze our partner community and build a viable ecosystem of products for nonprofits on Salesforce.com
  * help make integrations more plentiful
  * make things easier for integrators to work with Nonprofit organizations
  * serve the smaller organizations first
  * not necessarily be the solution for all organizations, particularly large, more sophisticated organizations
## The Nonprofit Starter Pack Community ##
The Nonprofit Starter Pack community exists primarily through mailing lists, the issue tracker and, to a lesser extent, the source control repository. Please contribute to the discussion and you can also help us to keep the effectiveness of the groups high by following and promoting the guidelines listed here.

### Please Be Friendly ###

Showing courtesy and respect to others is a vital part of the nonprofit Salesforce.com community. We base our community on four key values:

  * Politeness
  * Respect
  * Trust
  * Humility

This community is driven by a strong desire to make nonprofits more successful. To that end, please do not shrink from giving and receiving constructive feedback. Increasing the efficacy of nonprofits is foremost--we will always keep that as our mission.

### Where to Discuss the Nonprofit Starter Pack ###

We will send out announcements about the Nonprofit Starter Pack (release notifications, etc.), at the [Nonprofit Stater Pack Announce group](http://groups.google.com/group/npsp-announce).

Discussions about the use of the Nonprofit Starter Pack can now be had at the [Nonprofit Starter Pack User list](http://groups.google.com/group/nonprofit-starter-pack-users).

Please discuss the functionality, code, and use of the Nonprofit Starter Pack at the [Nonprofit Starter Pack Discuss group](http://groups.google.com/group/npsp-discuss).

The best broad-reaching discussion about nonprofit use of Salesforce.com lives in the [Nonprofit Salesforce group](http://groups.google.com/group/npsf).

## Code Review ##
The Salesforce.com Foundation will be the final arbiter of what is in and out of the NPSP, and own the packages that are deployed. Many of us have a stake in what the NPSP is and how it works. We want everyone who has a stake in the Nonprofit Starter Pack to have a say in the direction.

|Our goal for the Nonprofit Starter Pack is to make it the best code possible. To this end, we're making our code public and desire feedback and help making it better.|

Google Code projects have built in [Code Review tools](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews). Browse the source and make comments in the code. We will read all comments to our code, and look forward to your contributions!

**_Also, check out the npsp/tags folder for recent unmanaged versions of all five starter pack packages combined into one instance, to make an unmanaged developer or sandbox edition installation easier.  Version information is included in the tag commit._**
