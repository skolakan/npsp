# Introduction #

Rolling up donations is a key need for all nonprofits doing donor management.

# Current State #

The one-to-one Account model uses Rollup Summary Fields and cross object formulas to rollup donations to the Contact. This is a great solution that is easy to implement. In the Individual Account model this is not an option. Rollups must be implemented in code.

# Problems with current State #

  * coding rollups for the Individual Account model is complex
